# StocksAsATimeTraveler

# I made this mini-project because I was interested in using pandas_datareader library and I had some free time.
# Please check if you have installed all the libraries. ( pandas_datareader & plotly )

January first, 2020. A time traveler (McFly) comes and misses an almanac with the 2020's records of the Mexican stock market (BMV).  

Somebody find it (Biff) and he decides to use it to get rich.  

He can trade stocks with no taxes or commissions if he:  
* Only trades the 35 stocks in the S&P list 
* Buy before the market is open and sell after is closed. 

How much money he will have by the end of 2020 if he invests only 1,000 MXN, every day choosing the stock that will have the best spread?
